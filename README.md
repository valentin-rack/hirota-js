# 🌐🛒🥋 HIROTA worldwide e-commerce simulator
This project is an **interactive e-commerce simulator** for HIROTA, built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

It reimagines HIROTA as a **modern international brand** while preserving the brand’s original craftsmanship, heritage, and minimalist aesthetic.  

The entire **UX/UI design and front-end implementation** are developed by me — from layout and component structure to interactive behavior and overall user experience.


<br>

## Objectives
- Design a clean, minimal, and consistent interface aligned with HIROTA’s visual language  
- Render all products dynamically through the DOM (no more prompts or alerts)  
- Allow users to add, remove, and view items directly from a visual shopping cart  
- Implement product filters and search interactions using higher-order array methods  
- Maintain cart data persistence through `localStorage` and JSON serialization  
- Provide real-time cart updates, total calculation, and visual feedback on user actions  
- Keep the experience intuitive, elegant, and faithful to HIROTA’s traditional craftsmanship

<br>

## Versions
- **HIROTA CART 1.0:** Functional shopping cart without DOM usage. All interactions rely on `prompt`, `alert`, and `confirm`.
- **HIROTA CART 2.0 (in progress):** Interactive and dynamic version built using the DOM API.  
  Products are rendered visually as cards; users can add or remove items from the cart,  
  view totals in real time, and persist their selections with `localStorage`.  
  Includes product filtering, event-driven logic, and a clean minimalist UI inspired by HIROTA design.

## Technologies
- **Figma** — wireframing, ux/ui design and layout prototyping  
- **HTML + CSS** — structural layout and visual styling of the interface  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — main logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling  
- **Classes & OOP** — structured product and cart modeling  
- **Array methods** — use of `forEach`, `find`, `filter`, `map`, `reduce`, and `sort`  
- **LocalStorage / JSON** — persistent data handling between sessions  
- **Git / GitHub** — version control and workflow management  
- **GitHub Pages** — live deployment environment
